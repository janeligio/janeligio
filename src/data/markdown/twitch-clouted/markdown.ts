## Pitch 

Ever wonder if any clouted person is viewing a twitch stream you're currently watching? This is the tool for you. View a twitch streamer's most popular viewers. 

## Why I Made This 

I wanted to create an application for React and also interface with the \`Twitch API\`, so this was born.

## Overview 

This web app doesn't really work anymore...so I wouldn't bother trying to visit the website. But when it did, you can type in a Twitch channel and search for viewers who had a lot of followers. Pretty simple.
